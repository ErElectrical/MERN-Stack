  <!-- Add the Foundation CSS file

    Foundation is another popular CSS framework that provides a responsive grid system and a large set of UI components.
     Foundation offers a modular approach, allowing developers to selectively include only the components they need,
      which makes it highly customizable. 
      It also includes additional features like flexbox-based grids,
       a Sass-based CSS preprocessor, and a variety of JavaScript plugins.
